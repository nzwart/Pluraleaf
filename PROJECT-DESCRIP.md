## Pluraleaf

### A project by Christopher Bremseth and Nicolaas Zwart.

We're building Pluraleaf so that users have access to a clean, simple interface for sharing locations that they’ve pinned on a map of the world. These locations or, in the parlance of the app, “leaves”, will be in a variety of filterable categories, such as:

* Want Ads (“Arbor Lodge household in need of a gardener…”)
* Sale Notices (“Free couch. Will remove pin when picked up.”)
* Events, both one-offs and recurring, (“Jazz-in-the-Park concert every Saturday.”)
* News (“Broken water main, avoid this intersection...”)

…and so many other possibilities. In short, we envision Pluraleaf as having a similar utility as Craigslist, and instead of a cascade of text it will be in the form of a digital map, reflecting how much web technology has advanced in the nearly three decades since that service was created. We think this clean, modern interface will make it easier for users to network locally than a similar “yellow-pages” type service. Also, having it in map form allows users to search in specific spatial areas within neighborhoods and cities, which they can’t easily do on Craigslist. In another reflection of our current era, users will be required to log in in order to post on and read from the map, and every account will require an associated phone number so as to enhance user safety.

* The code for all other routes was implemented from Feb 21st until March 11th and based on code in the FastAPI documentation on creating "path operations": https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/#step-3-create-a-path-operation
* The SQL queries within that route code were implemented from Feb 21st until March 11th and were all original, based on examples from CS340 modules 1, 3, 4, and 5.

#### `db_queries.sql`:
* All SQL queries were original and implemented on a sporadic basis from Feb. 21st through March 11th, and were based on examples in CS340 modules 1, 3, 4, and 5.

#### `DDL.SQL`:
* The SQL table creation and data insertion queries were implemented from Feb. 21st through March 11th and were original (other than the "SET" and final "COMMIT" queries), and based on learning from CS340 modules 1, 3, 4, and 5.
* The "SET" and final "COMMIT" queries were adapted from the CS340 Project Step 2 Draft assignment page: https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1946034/assignments/9456214?module_item_id=23809320
